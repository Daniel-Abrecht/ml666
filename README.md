# Markup Language 666 (ML666)

This is a markup language heavily inspired by XML & HTML.
I got rid of entities, added c-like escaping & comments, and some other stuff.
The name ML666 was choosen, because I couldn't find an unclaimed 3 or 4 letter acronym, so I just took some number.

The Project Homepage, along with some prebuilt documentation, can be found at [https://ml666-s.s.abrecht.li/](https://ml666-s.s.abrecht.li/).

For the formal syntax description, see [docs/syntax.abnf](docs/syntax.abnf) and [docs/syntax.xhtml](docs/syntax.xhtml).

For the semantics for parsers & tokenizers, see [docs/semantics.md](docs/semantics.md).

For an example, take a look at one of the files in the [test/](test/) directory, such as: [test/example.ml666](test/example.ml666).
